The system has the ability to add books to the library, lend books to readers, and receive books back. In addition, it can also list all the books available in the library.\n","\n","The problem is that the system is very slow and needs to be optimized. Your task is to analyze the code, identify areas of improvement and rewrite parts of the code to make it more efficient. Specifically, you are asked to perform the following improvements (update the below code and implement the following points):\n","\n","1. Identify and improve the data structures used to store books in the library and borrowed books. *Hint: Use an `set` instead of a `list` to store books in `Library.books` and `Library.borrowed_books` to make it more efficient to check if a book is present.**\n","\n","2. Avoid errors that could occur when attempting to borrow or return a book that is not present. *Hint: Use the `set.discard()` method instead of `list.remove()` in `Library.borrow_book()` and `Library.return_book()` to avoid errors if the book is not present.*\n","\n","3. Improve the efficiency of selecting a random book to lend or return. *Hint: Instead of selecting a random book from `Library.books` or `Library.borrowed_books` by indexing (which involves a conversion to list which is expensive), you can convert these sets to lists only once before the cycle.*\n","\n","4. Improve the efficiency of the function that lists all the books available in the library. *Hint: Instead of printing each book one by one in `Library.list_books()`, you can construct a complete string with all book titles and then print that string once.*\n","\n","5. Avoid repeated calls to `len()` in the body of loops.\n","\n","6. Use list comprehension to improve efficiency of book creation.. *Hint: Use list comprehension for book creation, which can be faster than using a for loop and repeatedly calling `Library.add_book()`.*\n","\n","7. Optimize checking the availability of borrowed books before attempting to return them. *Hint: Avoid checking `if library.borrowed_books:` before attempting to return a book. If you use sets and the `discard()` method, there is no need for this check.*"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"21bcb8c4","metadata":{},"source":["#### Read and update the following given code:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"8467465b","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Book 6\n","Book 7\n","Book 10\n","Book 11\n","Book 14\n","Book 15\n","Book 16\n","Book 17\n","Book 18\n","Book 19\n","Book 20\n","Book 21\n","Book 25\n","Book 26\n","Book 27\n","Book 28\n","Book 29\n","Book 30\n","Book 31\n","Book 32\n","Book 37\n","Book 38\n","Book 41\n","Book 43\n","Book 45\n","Book 46\n","Book 48\n","Book 49\n","Book 52\n","Book 56\n","Book 57\n","Book 58\n","Book 61\n","Book 64\n","Book 66\n","Book 68\n","Book 69\n","Book 71\n","Book 73\n","Book 75\n","Book 77\n","Book 78\n","Book 80\n","Book 81\n","Book 85\n","Book 89\n","Book 94\n","Book 96\n","Book 99\n","Book 100\n","Book 33\n","Book 23\n","Book 84\n","Book 42\n","Book 72\n","Book 5\n","Book 8\n","Book 35\n","Book 22\n","Book 4\n","Book 92\n","Book 95\n","Book 59\n","Book 97\n","Book 44\n","Book 54\n","Book 82\n","Book 3\n","Book 24\n","Book 34\n","Book 70\n","Book 86\n","Book 93\n","Book 79\n","Book 98\n","Listing took 0.0 seconds\n"]}],"source":["import random\n","import time\n","\n","class Book:\n","    def __init__(self, id, title, author, pages):\n","        self.id = id\n","        self.title = title\n","        self.author = author\n","        self.pages = pages\n","\n","class Library:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.books = {}\n","        self.borrowed_books = {}\n","\n","    def add_book(self, book):\n","        self.books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def borrow_book(self, book_id):\n","        book = self.books.pop(book_id, None)\n","        if book:\n","            self.borrowed_books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def return_book(self, book_id):\n","        book = self.borrowed_books.pop(book_id, None)\n","        if book:\n","            self.books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def list_books(self):\n","        return \"\\n\".join(book.title for book in self.books.values())\n","\n","# Create a library\n","library = Library(\"Codeville\")\n","\n","# Add some books\n","library.books = {i: Book(i, f\"Book {i}\", f\"Author {i}\", i*10) for i in range(1, 101)}\n","\n","# Borrow some books\n","for _ in range(50):\n","    book_id_to_borrow = random.choice(list(library.books.keys()))\n","    library.borrow_book(book_id_to_borrow)\n","\n","# Return some books\n","for _ in range(25):\n","    if library.borrowed_books:  # Check if there are books to return\n","        book_id_to_return = random.choice(list(library.borrowed_books.keys()))\n","        library.return_book(book_id_to_return)\n","\n","# List all the books\n","start_time = time.time()\n","print(library.list_books())\n","end_time = time.time()\n","\n","print(f\"Listing took {end_time - start_time} seconds\")"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"011996bc","metadata":{},"source":["## Exercise 2: Task Management System Optimization\n","\n","You are provided with code that simulates a task management system.
